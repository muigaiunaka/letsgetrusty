Run a hello world with 
`rustc 00-hello-world.rs`
this creates a compiled binary
then run:
./00-hello-world

The `main` function is special: it is always the first code that runs in every executable Rust program.

Rust style is to indent with four spaces, not a tab

`!` that comes after the `println` means that youâ€™re calling a macro instead of a normal function.
